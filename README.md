# HalpyDEMO v1.0

HalpyDEMO is a barebones version of HalpyBOT, the Hull Seals' IRC assistant. It is intended for use in
demonstrations of the Seals rescue processes and standard operating procedures, and was originally developed
for the recruiting event hosted by the New Pilots Initiative, in August 2021.

HalpyDEMO only supports Discord. No functionality for other chat platforms will be implemented.

# Installation

## Requirements
- Python 3.5+
- Pycord Python Library

## Usage
To install, download the latest [release](https://github.com/rik079/HalpyDEMO/releases) from our repository. Upload and extract the files to the directory or subdirectory you wish to install from, and create your own config.ini to fit your server, following the example config file provided.

## Troubleshooting
- Upon installation, be sure to replace the information in config.ini to match your own details.

## Support
If any issues are encountered during use of the bot, an [issue](https://github.com/rik079/HalpyDEMO/issues/new) may be filed. Requests for new features will not be considered.

## Roadmap
This project is not actively supported outside of Seals demonstrations. New features may be added if this benefits the organisation of events officially endorsed by the Hull Seals leadership.
